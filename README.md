# NCAA_March_Madness_Predictions_Mascots
The only file that needs to be run for this project is manipulate_ncaab_data.py

This file loads and manipulates the mascots.csv, NCAA_teams.json, and NCAA_teams.sqlite files that are also in this repository. Ensure all these files are in the same directory when running. 

The create_ncaab_data.py file is purely for reference of how the NCAA_teams.json and NCAA_teams.sqlite files were created, but contains an expired API key and will not work. 

Please read NCAA_Mascots_Final_Report.pdf for the full report on the development of this project, including its formation, issues faced, and limitations.
